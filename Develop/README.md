# Refactoring HTML and CSS Code for Accessibility. 

## User Story
 - As a web developer I want to make Horiseon's home page accessible to all users. 
 - I want this website to be search engine optimized. 
 - I want the web page to function correctly.

 ## Acceptance Criteria
 - When I have gone through the HTML code and found and organized semantic HTML elements.
 - When I have condensed the style.css code to be more accessible for the user.
 - When I have made a descriptibe but short title in HTML.
 - When I have corrected the page to make it function correctly. 

 ### What has been changed?
 1. Html semantic elements have been arranged to fit an accessible HTML structure. 
 2. Added alt tags to images for users who may not be able to see the images appear on the webpage.
 3. Condensed CSS code in style.css.
 4. Added comments to HTML and CCS code files so future developers are able to find certain elements of the code quickly.
